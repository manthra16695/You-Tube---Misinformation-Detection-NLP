breast cancer or breast carcinoma is an
uncontrolled growth of epithelial cells
within the breast it's the second most
common cancer in women but can also on
rare occasion affect men as well
breast cancer is also the second leading
cause of cancer deaths in women after
lung cancer this is largely due to the
fact that oftentimes breast cancers
don't cause any pain or discomfort until
they spread to nearby tissues
the breasts are milk-producing glands
that sit on the chest wall on either
side of the breastbone they lie on top
of the ribs and the pectoral muscles and
they're divided into three main parts
the glandular tissue that makes the milk
is made up of 15 to 20 lobules inside
each of these lie a bunch of grape like
structures called the AVO lie which are
modified sweat glands surrounded by a
basement membrane made largely of
collagen zooming in on the a voi there's
a layer of avalor cells that secrete
breast milk into the lumen which is the
space in the center of the gland
wrapping around the alveolus our special
myoepithelial cells that squeeze down
and push the milk out of the lumen of
the alveolus down the lactiferous ducts
and out one of the pores of the nipple
now surrounding the glandular tissue is
the stroma which contains adipose or fat
tissue and this makes up the majority of
the breast suspense Ettore ligaments
called Cooper's ligaments run through
the stroma and help keep it in place
these ligaments attach to the inner
surface of the breast on one end and the
pectoralis muscle on the other just
beneath the skin covering the breast
there's a network of tiny lymphatic
vessels that drain the lymph which is a
fluid containing cellular waste products
and white blood cells these lymphatic
vessels mainly drain into a group of
lymph nodes in the axilla or the armpit
now the cells of glandular tissue have
receptors for certain hormones like
estrogen and progesterone which are
released by the ovaries in prolactin
which is released by the pituitary gland
these hormones stimulate the ABI alure
cells to divide an increase in number
which makes the lobule enlarged
without these hormones the glandular
cells particularly the alveolar cells
can survive and undergo apoptosis which
is programmed cell death
for example after menopause estrogen
production stops which leads to death of
the Abiola cells and over time that
breast tissue gets replaced by fat
during the menstrual cycle there's
increased secretion of estrogen and
progesterone from the ovaries and right
after menstruation that secretion
decreases as a result during every
menstrual cycle the alveolar cells
undergo division and apoptosis men have
some breast tissue as well but they lack
milk secreting a voi
each time cells divide there's a chance
that a genetic mutation will occur and a
mutation can lead to tumor formation so
with more menstrual cycles there's an
increased risk of tumor formation that's
why there's an increased risk of breast
cancer with things that increase the
number of menstrual cycles like early
age of menarche which is the first
menstrual bleeding and late age of
menopause
similarly medications containing
estrogen also increase the risk of
breast cancer there are also other
environmental risk factors such as
ionizing radiation like from chest
x-rays and CT scans on the flip side
some things that are associated with a
decreased risk of breast cancer include
early pregnancy and a longer time
breastfeeding breast cancer has also
been linked to specific mutations in
tumor suppressor genes such as breast
cancer gene or brca1 and brca2 and T p53
which normally slowed down cell division
or make cells die if they divide
uncontrollably mutations in brca1 or
brca2 are both autosomal dominant
mutations which can be inherited and
cause familial breast cancer in addition
to breast cancer they also cause an
increased risk of ovarian cancer some
breast cancers also have mutations in
the erbb2 gene that increased human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or
her2 which when activated promotes the
growth of cells in males breast cancer
is usually caused by inherited mutations
in the brca1 and 2 genes once a
cancer-causing mutation does occur the
affected cell which is most commonly an
epithelial cell that lines the ducts or
the lobules begins to grow and replicate
out of control forming a tumor this
tumor also called an in situ carcinoma
is initially localized within the
basement membrane of the apo eye and can
be of two types
the first type is called ductal
carcinoma in situ or DCIS and that's
where tumor cells grow from the wall of
the ducts into the women if left
untreated DCIS over time can cross the
basement membrane to become invasive
ductal carcinoma also cancer cells from
DCIS can migrate along the elective
first duct and through the pore onto the
skin over the nipple this is called
Paget disease of the nipple these cancer
cells release a substance called
mobility factor which helps them break
into and settle in between the squamous
epithelial cells as the cancer cells
move into the epithelium there's
inflammation which brings extracellular
fluid out through breaks in the skin
this fluid then dries and forms crusts
over the skin surface
the second type is called lobular
carcinoma in situ or LC is and that's
where clusters of tumor cells grow
within the lobules
without invading the ducts causing the
affected a voi to enlarge unlike DCIS
over time LC is doesn't cross the
basement membrane to form invasive
lobular carcinoma LC is got its name
many years ago before it was realized
that it's not a breast cancer in the
sense that it doesn't invade surrounding
tissues just like healthy avio ourselves
some breast cancer cells have hormone
receptors that allow them to grow in the
presence of the hormones based on the
type of hormone receptors breast cancers
can be divided into three major types
estrogen receptor or ER positive and
her2 negative carcinoma which is most
common her2 positive and ER positive
negative carcinoma and ER negative in
her to negative carcinoma breast cancer
can cause a few complications first the
tumor causes local inflammation which
causes damage to the suspensory
ligaments and latias ducts resulting in
their fibrosis next the cancer can
invade nearby tissues like the pectoral
muscles below and the skin above cancer
cells can also enter and block the thin
lymphatic vessels which causes lymph to
build up in the interstitial space
normally this fluid buildup what causes
swelling but the attachment of suspense
Atari ligaments doesn't allow the skin
to stretch so the skin becomes thickened
and dimpled like an orange peel called
po d'orange appearance finally tumor
cells can spread via the blood to the
spine brain and bone or the lymph to
other sites like axillary lymph nodes
and the other breast in males breast
tissue is very thin which makes it
easier for the cancer to spread to
underlying tissues the first symptom of
breast cancer is a hard painless lump or
swelling which is most commonly in the
upper and outer part of the breast
additionally there may be a swelling
under the armpit if cancer is spread to
the axillary lymph nodes the breast can
become a mobile and fixed or stuck onto
the chest wall due to infiltration if
cancer cells spread into the pectoral
muscles another symptom is dimpling of
the skin over the breast due to
involvement of the skin fibrosis of
taras ducks and suspense story ligaments
causes retraction or pulling in of the
nipples when pageant disease is present
it can cause itching redness crusting
and discharge from the nipple diagnosis
of breast cancer usually begins by
feeling a breast lump breast cancer can
be treated effectively when it is
detected early in the course of the
disease
that's why regular screaming with
mammography which is an x-ray of the
breasts is done in high-risk individuals
in addition imaging using ultrasound and
MRI may be done to detect the tumor
finally a biopsy of the swelling or a
fine needle aspiration and cytology
where fluid from the swelling is taken
may be done to confirm the diagnosis to
determine the risk of breast cancer
each one is staged by the TNM system t
indicates the size of the tumor and
whether or not it is grown in nearby
areas for example the chest wall muscles
and describes the degree to which cancer
has spread to nearby lymph nodes
particularly the axillary lymph nodes
and finally M indicates the degree to
which the cancer has spread to other
sites or metastasized each of these
categories is ranked from zero to four
with four being the most severe finally
the combinations of these sub stages
determine the stage group which are
assigned zero to four treatment for
breast cancer is based on the type and
stage of the cancer but commonly
involves surgery radiation therapy
chemotherapy and hormonal therapy
localized tumors are removed surgically
by partial mastectomy where the affected
part is removed in larger tumors which
have spread to nearby tissue are removed
by total mastectomy where the entire
breast is removed
in addition nearby structures like lymph
nodes may also be removed if the cancer
has metastasized to them
hormone therapy is used when tumor cells
have hormone receptors like estrogen and
her2 in may include medications which
block the formation or effects of
estrogen all right as a quick recap
breast cancer or breast carcinoma is the
uncontrolled growth of epithelial cells
lining the ducks and lobules of the
breast breast cancer usually begins as
an in situ carcinoma which can either be
ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS which
is localized to the ducts or lobular
carcinoma in
at you or LCIS which is localized within
the lobules over time in situ carcinoma
can invade the basement membrane to
become invasive carcinoma involving the
ducks and lobules breast cancer
screening by mammography is done for
early detection of cancer which can be
treated by a variety of treatment
options including surgery radiation
therapy chemotherapy in hormonal therapy

colon cancer in just two days
unfortunately colon cancer is one of the
most common cancer types in both men and
women this terrible disease takes
millions of lives around the world but
wait we have good news for you a group
of experts have found that this powerful
ingredient can kill 93% of colon cancer
cells in just 2 days
amazing right and now you probably ask
yourself what's the name of the secret
ingredient well we can answer that
question for you we're talking about the
super healthy coconut oil a recent study
conducted by group of researchers at the
Adelaide University of Australia has
discovered that lauric acid found in
coconut oil eliminates almost 93% of
colon cancer cells just after two days
of treatment coconut oil contains high
amounts of lauric acid well it's almost
half of the content of coconut oil
according to the experts the lauric acid
contaminates the cancer cells by
releasing intense oxidative stress
during this process the lauric acid
reduces the levels of glutathione in
cancer cells very efficiently the
glutathione in cancer cells is used to
protect them from oxidative stress other
studies have revealed the anti-cancer
properties of coconut oil as well the
coconut oil is known for its healing
properties and benefits and it's used by
many people in the world for many years
other studies have revealed that coconut
oil is extremely efficient in
eliminating bacteria various diseases
parasites fungi and harmful
microorganisms it's also extremely
useful and beneficial in promoting
digestion AIDS liver health improves
skin health reduces inflammation and
accelerates wound healing this super
healthy ingredient is loaded with
healthy nutrients and it can provide
many health benefits but the big
corporations tend to downplay its
efficacy
the medical experts say that this
powerful ingredient is very useful and
beneficial in preventing and fighting
many different health problems such as
diabetes osteoporosis viral ailments
mononucleosis hepatitis C herpes and so
forth biliary tract infections cron
sickness and cancer
ladies and gentlemen did you know that
back in the 1960s food manufacturers
wanted consumers to buy their marjorie's
and hydrogenated oils the answer is yes
and in order to do that they had to
discredit the products people had always
used in their homes to prepare their
food the coconut oil has been accused of
causing health issues while it was its
replacements that were the real culprits
many experts and researchers don't think
that coconut oil is the natural cure for
cancer but it's a reminder for all the
scientists in the world who work in this
field that Mother Nature has provided
many means and tools to fight this
terrible and lethal disease and we all
should invest more in the medical
researches and studies of these natural

this is the logo of my shop which is
found in the heart yeah
and then my god did up with the G
so these are all the herbs lemongrass I
use also to cure my cancer and then bail
is good for mosquitoes and it's a good
antibiotic sweet basil oregano is
another antibiotic got the call that's
good for the brain
so my help and I like I eat from the
garden every day so you grow all your
own earth yeah
like here to marry that's turmeric yeah
all all of this and then I yes because
because the the pharmaceuticals come
from plants and then they reengineer it
so we are why don't you just eat it
fresh no there's more energy like the
mint I think this is the mint when I
have when I have stomach trauma he's the
one yeah mmm try it's really good it's
really good for digestion
okay how much time you spend out here I
have not much time I'm mostly in my in
my house but I love this no you can lie
down here
and then feel the fresh air
so you were talking about when you had
cancer yeah and you were saying that you
use stage 1 stage 1 for stage 1 and then
they gave me the piece of paper and and
you know they were like so scared they
were giving it to me and I said what's
up and I said they said you have to do
this and that and I said no way I said
no this no this no no and I didn't tell
anyone I didn't tell anyone because I
didn't want to be bothered and I
contacted two doctors one is a nature
nature path and the other one is an
alternative doctor that lives in
Tennessee and so the nature path put me
on a regimen of turmeric where you soak
the turmeric overnight and then you
scrub it in the morning and then you
drink the juice pure like about an ounce
so I do that in the morning and then he
still do that today yeah I still do it
I'd everything I did for cancer I still
do it now and then a few minutes later I
take graben or Booya bono is equivalent
to the most potent chemotherapy in town
that's what the data says so I eat the
pulp afresh then I do frankincense
because I did so many things I don't
even know what you mean
what kind of cancer did you breast
cancer yeah we said the best to
Singapore so it was validated that we
diversity but I never had fear because
as far as I knew it was a piece of paper
and I talked to people when did you feel
worse we're told that you have cancer
when that piece of paper or now after
the chemo and all of them said they feel
worse now and I said so why would I do
this and then I actually got healthier
and happier because so I never felt this
content operates on fear why do you do
chemo and all this because you're so
afraid you're gonna die you know but
I've talked to so many people and
they're just so many people that have
been able to cure themselves doing
horrible things and nobody not many
people know about it but everyone's
different right they're different
three different stages but I would I
wouldn't go the chemical approach right
away
at the end of the day you live your life
and you do what's best for you how you
do what's best and then you know yeah we
have a very childlike personalities how
do you hold on to that it may be part of
it is meditation because I don't like
complexity
I don't like complexity Center so I
always like to feel that it's so
interesting because I'm one of one of
six and my mom and my dad always say to
me Trisha you are out Peter Pan child
you're a child who never wanted to never
wanted to grow up and it's interesting
because at first when you meet you you
know you see you and you know your
wonderfulness and then it's interesting
because more and more as we get to
talking to each other and walking around
your house with you you are you're very
childlike you're very warm you're very
nurturing yeah because it's the wonder
of life yeah we have this lively enjoy
if you say to me how come how come I'm

the next several weeks we're going to
take a look at ways you can improve your
well-being and the new procedures that
may give you a better quality of life
and this week we're looking at some of
the breakthroughs in breast cancer a
drug cocktail is being called a miracle
for women with an aggressive form of the
disease but not all women who might
benefit can get access to it we're
taking action for your health with why
and what you need to know when it came
back it was Susan Clark is a member of a
unique team a group of women fighting an
aggressive form of breast cancer with a
new drug cocktail that's keeping them
alive diagnosed with her2 positive
breast cancer her oncologist dr. Wade
Weaver recommended she get this cocktail
of chemo including Herceptin and newly
approved Pro Jetta the combination
shrunk her tumor before surgery and
afterwards tests showed it did the job
for me as it is right now I'm clear she
had what we call a complete pathologic
response a complete disappearance of her
breast cancer cells exciting news doctor
Weaver says just listen to these stats
before either of these drugs came along
patients who receive chemotherapy before
their surgery to remove their breast
cancer would see a complete
disappearance of their cancer cells in
5% or less of cases once Herceptin was
added to the mix those numbers improved
into the 30 35 percent range and now
adding per jetta to that same cocktail
we're seeing numbers north of 60% and
this offers the best prognosis for the
patient long term but dr. Weaver says
not all women with her2 positive breast
cancer are able to get this drug
cocktail
so if patients want to receive this drug
and have their insurance company cover
it and it's appropriate use they would
need to receive it prior to their
surgery to remove their breast cancer
Susan and the doctor just want to make
sure that women diagnosed with her type
of cancer educate themselves so their
outcome can be is positive and if you'd

dated for four years before he finally
popped the question they set a date and
started planning the big day there's one
thing they failed to consider Wayne who
worked as a postal worker had lost
weight and developed a persistent cough
first he dismissed it it progressed and
just kept going and wouldn't go away and
I would eat things it wouldn't make it
happened any exercise would make that
coffee come up Heather finally convinced
Wayne to see a doctor I I could hear a
rattling when he breathed he just could
not stop coughing he would just have to
literally wait it out it turned out that
Wayne had fluid in his lungs a number of
tests gave no indication of what was
causing the build-up doctors even
considered it might have come from his
military service in Desert Storm
finally Wayne had a laparoscopy Heather
called his hospital room from work and I
said well do they know what it is and he
said yeah and I said what is it is it to
work you losest so her you know Desert
Storm disease or any number of things
and his voice cracked and he said no
it's cancer Wayne was diagnosed with
malignant mesothelioma a cancer that
normally shows up in people in their 60s
who have been exposed to asbestos Wayne
was 25 even with treatment that doctors
gave him a year to 18 months to live
Heather and Wayne's dreams were
shattered
oh the way I described it later was I
just felt like someone pulled the pin on
a grenade and threw it to me and said
here Heather catch because you know I
was just about to have my future and I
just felt like that was getting ripped
away despite the horrible news
Heather still wanted to get married I
asked Wayne what that meant to him
and yeah but I was gonna be marrying the
right person on June 14th 1997 they
married in sickness and in health those
vows had a lot of significance more so
for he and I than I think the average
couple but a lot of our family and
friends were there it just was such a
joyful experience everything we had
hoped it would be it was because we
really needed that the couple faced
another big decision Wayne's treatment
the doctors recommended radiation but it
wasn't a cure and offered little hope of
even extending his life with much prayer
discussion they decided against it the
only real hope they had left was prayer
Wayne often poured his heart out to God
as he drove to work it was a time for me
to just pray to God saying God this is
my desire I really want to be more than
anything in the world that husband and a
father it was also good because I was
able to save the guy in you I want your
will to be done my mom gave us the
scripture Jeremiah 29:11 which says I
know the plans I have for you declares
the Lord plans to give you a future and
a hope and that really kind of became my
prayer for Wayne because I wanted to get
old and wrinkly with him over time Wayne
lost 50 pounds and every six weeks
doctors drained the fluid from his lungs
in the abdomen in the meantime they
started a family 11 months after we were
married I got pregnant with our first
daughter and when the kids came along I
just really wanted them to know their
dad because he's a phenomenal father and
wonderful man Wayne Heather and hundreds
of family and friends pray daily for
healing another year passed and another
two more children came Wayne put on
weight and looked healthier but every
six weeks the doctors drained more fluid
then finally something changed I'd go in
and there wasn't as much fluid and in at
one point you know in about three or
four months period I went in there was
nothing
no fluid four years after the diagnosis
the fluids completely stopped and today
there's not a trace of cancer in Wayne's
lungs it's a miracle they attribute to
God's grace and prayer he's alive
because of it so we give the testimony
we try to give God all the praise honor
and glory because he is a miracle
Wayne's a miracle I've had 10 years of
being a husband and got four kids and
those were my two prayers originally
just I want to be a husband and father
I'd be given that and I I love it
Heather recently gave birth to their
fourth child she rejoices that her
children will grow up with their dad
and she'll grow old with the man she
loves my husband is not alive and well

alive a while because I storm the gates

along with part of her intestines it's
life changing
well you'd end up wearing a permanent

they would have I don't know what they
would have done to my body while still

all I heard was her living God talked to

not yours to have do not take this don't
embrace this it's not yours to take
you're gonna fight for your life he kept
saying you're gonna fight for your life

knew it was time to change her thinking

have cancer well I don't want to have
cancer said this is not I've changed my
vocabulary it's not ours to have no

changed the way Mike I spoke this is not
mine to keep that's what he kept telling
me this is not yours to embrace do not
take it in you're gonna fight for your

the Bible she posted scriptures all over
her house and I printed out pages of
healing and encouraging verses I know
that I was fenced in by massive prayer

know like Matthew 19:26 what's
impossible with man is possible with God
praying for Marilee were friends and

chemo and radiation took its toll I
couldn't barely walk after a while I was
a week and I just barely could just lay
here on the couch
because I just couldn't do much
sometimes when the pain was so so hard
I'm vigorously was quoting the
scriptures out loud and commanding and
putting a demand on the word contending
well I can tell you is God carries us in
the most difficult trials of our life
after seven months of treatment Marilee
went to the doctor for a checkup and she
said I want to tell you something
there's no evidence of any tumor there's
no evidence of all the radiation this is
an out-of-the-box miracle this is beyond
anything she said I've ever seen in my
life no one can take credit for this
except God
she said if any was to examine you
without seeing your reports they would
never ever know that you had this and
the treatment that you have I was so
thrilled to hear that news those are
words that you you never think you're
gonna hear and but God stepped in he's
faithful his word is faithful his word
is alive today over five years later
Marilee is still cancer-free she knows
it was the power of prayer that carried
her through those dark days of chemo and
radiation I wouldn't be here without the
power of prayer and out that without the

Breast cancer is the most common cancer
that a woman will develop throughout her lifetime,
and over the course of a woman's lifetime,
approximately one in eight will develop breast cancer.
Most breast cancers are picked up on mammograms
even before it can be felt on somebody's examination,
however, there are some signs that a woman should be
aware of in her breasts that are not normal.
If one feels a mass, a lump, dimpling in her nipple,
things that don't look symmetric
new lumps and bumps in armpits
redness of the skin, things that are warm to touch
Inflammatory breast cancer is a rare
form of breast cancer
It's a condition where the whole breast becomes red,
sometimes warm, sometimes swollen
and it can often be mixed up with an infection
of the breast, called mastitis.
and although most of the time when redness
of the breast occurs, it is an infection
or something non-cancer related,
it is very important to tell your healthcare provider
if you notice changes in the skin.
Most breast cancers are not hereditary,
meaning that there isn't a clear genetic link
to most breast cancer.
There is a small proportion of breast cancer
about five to ten percent of women with breast cancer
who do have a genetic predisposition for breast cancer,
meaning that they inherited a gene
from their mother or father
that made them more likely to develop breast cancer
over the course of their lifetime.
If you have a mother or a sister,
what we call a first-degree relative
that means you may have a slightly increased risk
for breast cancer,
and this is something you should talk to your healthcare
provider about, because it may change the amount of
screening that we do, the age that you start,
and the frequency or different types of tests
that you may have.
Although routine self breast exams are not a part of
usual recommendations anymore,
If you ever feel something that doesn't feel normal
to you
or that is a change in your breast that you're not used to
you should definitely call your healthcare provider
so that they know what's going on
and they can bring you in, likely for an examination.

and the different types of breast cancer
we're going to teach you all about it
[Music]
when diagnosed with breast cancer the
first question that you invariably get
from family and friends is what type of
breast cancer do you have and what stage
is your breast cancer interestingly your
breast cancer specialists don't focus
too much on this why I'll try to explain
in this lesson I'm going to teach you
what the different types of breast
cancer are predominantly non invasive
breast cancer an invasive breast cancer
I'm then going to pivot and explain to
you the five stages of breast cancer
starting from stage zero which is more
of a precancerous condition all the way
to stage 4 which means cancer spread to
other organs in the body I'm also going
to teach you why stage is important but
not as important as you might think in
deciding the best cancer treatment
options for you so let's get started
I'm going to tell you about the
different types of breast cancer now
type is a reference to the unique
features of cancer cells under the
microscope it's different than stage
which I'll cover in a few minutes and
it's different than grade so of breast
cancer type but one difference you need
to know is that pre cancer cells or DCIS
is a is a precancerous condition those
are cells that are evolving and we think
might evolve into invasive cancer that
can invade other parts of the body and
threaten you
if not treated well so that's about 20%
of cancers DCIS pre cancer the vast
majority is invasive breast cancer and
there are two cell types that are the
most common one is called invasive
ductal carcinoma and the and that
accounts for about 70 percent of breast
cancers and invasive lobular carcinoma
which which accounts for about 20%
there's some other types
typically we treat these two cancer's
generally in the same fashion they
generally have the same threat to you
within invasive breast cancer we label
some different types of breast cancer
based on their receptors and I'll give
you a couple of those one is called
triple negative breast cancer another is
called her2 positive breast cancer and
those are two cancer cell types that are
more threatening to you and generally
chemotherapy is recommended to best
treat the vast majority of breast
cancers or hormonal e responsive cancers
estrogen sensitive breast cancers and
are treated with hormonal therapies
let's cover early stage breast cancer
the way we would define that is stage 0
which is pre cancer usually defined as
DCIS or stage 1 into invasive cancer so
I've covered DCIS it's a precancerous
condition we still treat it with surgery
radiation sometimes some heat some
hormonal therapy but let's move out on
the side although it does account for
about 20% of people that are diagnosed
with breast cancer
Stage 1 into early stage and face of
breast cancer the outlook is generally
very good stage 1 breast cancer is when
the tumor is small less than 2
centimeters in size so less than 3
quarters of an inch in size and there's
no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes
the outlook is excellent we cover
survival based on stage elsewhere in the
breast cancer school for patients stage
2 is a little bit more advanced a little
bit more threatening for early stage
breast cancer so once way to simplify it
is that stage 2 breast cancer is one
that is a little larger than 2
centimeters maybe just over an inch in
diameter but no evidence of cancer in
the lymph nodes or possibly small a
centimeter in size and there's evidence
of cancer in one or two or three
underneath our later stage breast cancer
stage 3 and stage 4 breast cancer really
make up later stage breast cancer so let
me cover stage 3 breast cancer first
stage 3 breast cancer cancer is
generally when the tumor is larger maybe
4 5 6 centimeters in size most stage 3
breast cancers have evidence of cancer
in the lymph nodes or multiple lymph
nodes not every one of many inflammatory
breast cancer where the cancer presents
with swelling and redness and thickening
of the skin that is a stage 3 breast
cancer but stage 3 breast cancer when we
take a deep look and look at cat-scans
Boden scans and PET scans do not have
metastatic disease they do not have
evidence of cancer that we can find
elsewhere in the body and the bone the
brain the liver and other parts of the
body so it has yet to spread elsewhere
at least that we can find stage 3 breast
cancer the majority of these patients
are treated upfront before surgery with
chemotherapy to shrink the cancer cells
to kill any cancer cells that might be
elsewhere in the body that we cannot
find following chemotherapy generally
patients undergo surgery and following
surgery radiation therapy and then if
their tumor is sensitive to estrogen
then they undergo hormonal therapy and
towards stage 4 breast cancer is a real
threat to your life that means that we
have been able to determine that cancer
has spread and grown in other parts of
the body and that's what people die of
of breast cancer generally cancer that
is growing elsewhere in the body
we typically treat patients that come to
see us at presentation with metastatic
disease with either chemotherapy first
or hormonal therapy first surgery can
play a role for some patients surgery in
the breast and radiation can play a role
in a few situations so when you put it
all together later stage breast cancer
is a much bigger threat than early-stage
breast cancer we can treat it and treat
it effectively early stage breast cancer
survival is much better than later stage
breast cancer and that's why we do less
chemotherapy with earlier stage breast
cancer and more chemotherapy later stage
breast cancer so why is breast cancer
stage not as important as it was in the
past
why are my physicians not telling me
immediately what stage I am stage 1 2 3
or 4 well for many many years stage the
size of the tumor whether cancers in the
lymph nodes or it's gone elsewhere was
the best way for us to identify patients
at low risk probably not needing
chemotherapy on high-risk those that
would need chemotherapy but I mean we're
talking 20 30 40 years ago now we have
much more sophisticated ways of
determining whether cancer is more of a
threat we check receptors estrogen
progesterone hurt too and others grade
we can look under the microscope and see
if the cells are a little bit more angry
higher grade versus just becoming cancer
and not as angry lower grade we have
genomic assays that look deeper into
cancer cells to determine whether
someone is at a higher risk for the
cancer coming back you might more
benefit from chemotherapy rather than
hormonal therapy or radiation or not so
we have a lot more sophisticated ways to
tailor our recommendations to treat your
cancer to you
and as you're getting the sense breast
cancer is very complicated and it's why
the breast cancer school for patients
recommends that you educate yourself and
engage your physicians to learn more
about breast cancer type and breast
cancer stage visit the breast cancer
school for patients where we will teach
you everything you need to know we're

things and tips that I can offer you for how to relieve some of that discomfort in the
postoperative period.
So, one of the things that a lot of women find useful is to use an ice pack wrapped
in a towel after they have had a lumpectomy or even a mastectomy without reconstruction
and that is something that can help reduce the swelling and ease some of the discomfort.
It's important though to remember to wrap that ice pack in a towel or some kind of blanket,
so that the ice is not directly touching the skin because that can certainly burn the skin,
especially since after breast surgery, you are often numb over the area of the wound.
After a lumpectomy, it's also really good idea to wear a supportive bra and usually
your surgeon will give you a surgical bra or something like that after your surgery
that you are already been wearing in the recovery room and the reason for that is after a lumpectomy,
any kind of excessive movement or bouncing of the breast can provoke discomfort, so it's
good to keep that supportive bra on for about a week or so.
After that recovery period is done, there are some exercises that you can also try to
help relieve some of the stiffness that lot of women will report, especially in the axilla
or armpits if they have had surgery in that region or even after a mastectomy without
reconstruction.
Some of those exercises can include things like basically just holding your hands in
the center and doing just some elbow lifts up to about the 90 degree position, do it
up until the point that you feel discomfort, then hold it a little bit, take a deep-deep
breath and if the discomfort goes away, you can go little bit higher, if the discomfort
stays, go ahead and release and come back down.
Another activity that is really good, especially if you have had surgery in the armpit is to
gently walk your fingers up a wall, so stand right next to a vertical wall and just slowly
walk your fingers up and up and up and eventually you want to get all the way to the top, all
of that can take a little while before you get there.
Those are just two examples, but certainly your surgeon or your physical therapist could
give you more ideas of activities to try to improve your range of motion and ease some
of the stiffness that you might have after your surgery that gives you the discomfort.

15,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hgrfXleNsM,46,50,7,11611,"Breast cancer is a cancer that originates in the breast.
What's important to know about breast cancer is that even though all breast cancer comes
out of one part of the body, it's actually three different diseases.
The three main categories are defined by the receptors on the outside of the cancer cells.
One of the most important things to know is what kind of breast cancer is it.
The entire treatment plan depends on which category of breast cancer someone's diagnosed with.
So sitting down with one of the doctors and going through the pathology report to really
understand what is the diagnosis and what type of breast cancer is it.
The largest category of breast cancer is hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
That means breast cancer that has estrogen and/or progesterone receptors on the outside.
The second most common type has a different kind of receptor called HER2.
The third type of breast cancer, which is the smallest category, lacks the receptors
for estrogen and progesterone and lacks the HER2 receptor.
Therefore, it has none of those three receptors.
We call it triple negative breast cancer.
There usually are at least three doctors who are on the breast cancer treatment team.
This includes a surgeon who does breast surgery, a radiation oncologist who may or may not
be necessary on the team, and then a medical oncologist who provides what's called systemic
therapy, so therapy that goes throughout the body.
It's very important for someone newly diagnosed with breast cancer to have a treatment team
that she or he feels comfortable with and who communicate well together and can work
as a team to make the best treatment plan.
There are many factors that the treatment team needs to consider.
The three main categories that I think about include the anatomy of the cancer.
This is the stage of breast cancer.
How large is the cancer?
And is there any evidence the cancer could have gotten into the lymph nodes under the
arm, what we consider the regional lymph nodes.
The next category is the biology of the cancer, like the personality.
This has to do with those categories of breast cancer, hormone receptor positive, HER2 positive,
or triple negative and some other features about the growth pattern of the cancer.
And then the third category is who is the person with the breast cancer diagnosis.
What is their health like?
Are there other important health issues that the treatment team needs to consider?
And also, what are someone's preferences?
What do they want to do in terms of their treatment decisions?
All of those features come together to make a treatment plan.
So for someone who is newly diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, meaning cancer
limited to the breast and/or regional lymph nodes, there are typically two main parts
of treatment, what we call local therapy and systemic therapy.
Local therapy means treatments that are focused and directed on specific parts of the body
such as on the breast and lymph nodes.
And this includes surgery and can also include radiation treatments.
In a woman who has had a lumpectomy, meaning that the breast is preserved, often radiation
treatment is included in the program as well.
If someone's had a mastectomy, most of the time radiation is not necessary, but occasionally
it will be recommended as well.
Systemic therapy means whole body treatment, so something that someone will take by mouth
or vein that travels everywhere in the body, not just breast and lymph node areas.
And this is the type of treatment that a medical oncologist provides.
There are three main categories of systemic treatment that a medical oncologist can select from.
We have what's called hormone therapies, also known as endocrine therapies.
And these are the medicines that block the body's hormones from stimulating cancer cells.
This includes pill medicines such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors.
The second category is the chemotherapy category.
Most of the time that's intravenous treatment.
And then the third category, what we sometimes think of as the most exciting category in
breast cancer, is what we call targeted or biologic therapy.
That means treatments that are very specific for cancers and very precise for cancers but
are not chemotherapy treatments and are really designed to go after the cancer but not harm
or touch any other tissues in the body.
When a person who's newly diagnosed with breast cancer sits down with their medical oncologist,
they can review each of these categories and see which medicines, if any, from any of these
categories would be appropriate to treat the cancer.
There's kind of two large arenas of progress that we've seen over the past several years
for breast cancer.
The first one has to do with how much treatment is appropriate for someone with a breast cancer diagnosis.
If we look at the history of how we've developed our successful breast cancer treatments, it's
usually by adding more and more treatments to the program.
More surgery.
More radiation.
More chemotherapy.
The newest trend, though, is realizing that not every person needs the same treatment.
Treatment should not be homogenous.
Instead, it should be highly personalized to a person and to his or her situation.
And so the newest research is actually looking at ways to pull back and to give exactly what's
needed to best treat the cancer but not expose somebody to a treatment that's unnecessary
or unhelpful.
So we actually now see situations where we're able to pull back and not have to offer chemotherapy
in the ways we might have in the past or not have to do excessive surgery if that's not
necessary for the treatment program.
The other main area where we've seen great progress is in this category of targeted therapies.
There's a wealth of targeted therapies that have been evaluated in clinical trials, and
every year we are seeing these medicines emerge out of trials, become FDA approved, and become
part of our standard treatment program.

family history of benign processes are
usually related to those same processes
that occur in the family but not always
so many women who come in that are young
have fibroadenomas and they'll say oh my
mother had them too but we still want to
make sure that that's what it is
anytime someone has a lump and make sure
that it's the process that we think it
is there are a variety of causes of
breast lumps probably the most common in
women around their 30s 40s and 50s as
fibrocystic breast disease fibrocystic
breast disease is a normal well many
people say we shouldn't even call it a
disease and call it change and that's
because so many women have it and it
really is just that parts of the breast
form cysts and parts of the breast or a
little more dense breast tissue and that
makes it feel like a lump as a compared
to the other areas those are benign we
do not generally worry about them we
just reassure people they're also
generally somewhat painful or have some
discomfort associated with them
particularly if you push on them and
that generally means that it's not
something that we need to worry too much
about other causes in younger women are
fibroadenomas which are a benign process
it's just an overgrowth of the
supporting tissues in the breast not the
parts that make the milk but the parts
that support the parts that make the
milk an overgrowth of those cells can
result in these lumps that occur in
young women and older women
we generally worry that there could be a
cancer there if they're beyond menopause
so those we would worry a little more
about
so all lumps in the breasts need to be
evaluated by one of your physicians if
it's a lump that has been there and it
tends to get bigger and smaller and gets
smaller over time we generally in young
women will ask them to wait 1 min stroll
cycle to see what happens to the lump if
it's someone who's had a lot of breast
cysts and it feels a lot like all of
their other cysts then waiting a cycle
to see if it changes or goes away is
reasonable and not seeking care for it
if it's something that persists or
something that feels very firm then it
is something that we should evaluate and
it persists means if it lasts more than
6 weeks or so and or if it gets
progressively larger and doesn't get
larger and smaller with menstrual cycles
in women after menopause any lump that
develops should be evaluated by a
physician either your primary care
physician first or an ob/gyn or a breast
specialist someone who takes care of
breast diseases so all patients with
lumps in the breast should get an
ultrasound if you're before the age of
mammography then we would just get an
ultrasound so if your before 30 the
first thing we would do would be
ultrasound and not mammography
the treatment of breast lumps depends on
what we think it is so if it is
something that is just a simple cyst we
can either just watch it with ultrasound
or just watch by physical exam or we can
aspirate it which means we just use a
small needle it's sort of like drawing
blood but actually easier than drawing
blood because the cysts are usually
bigger than a vein and so you just have
to stick a needle in it and draw it out
like you would draw blood so cysts are
pretty easily treated in the office we
just aspirate them if they're painful or
causing symptoms if they're not painful
or not too symptomatic we can just leave
them alone and watch them fibroadenomas
are the lump that can occur in young
women these if they're small can be
watched they can be multiple so some
women have four or five of them if they
are in general with fibroadenomas I tell
women that they get big 1/3 get bigger
1/3 gets smaller and 1/3 stay the same
size if they're staying the same size or
getting smaller you don't have to do
anything about them they're the criteria
for doing surgery on them or if the two
if the lump is bigger than 3 centimeters
in size if it's painful or if it's
getting larger or if the president just
doesn't like having a lump there then we
can remove them those are usually
removed through incisions that are
relatively small and placed in locations
that can be a little more hidden in an
effort to reduce the changes that occur
in the women in the young woman's
breasts other lumps like lumps that
might be cancers that we're worried that
could be a cancer we would do a needle
biopsy first to determine what it is and
then once we have those results then we
make a decision on what to do for
treatment

stated as this occurring far apart in
time unusual or uncommon and when we
hear the word rare our brains check out
and we automatically think that this can
never happen to me but not once and that
definition does it say the word
impossible okay coming back to that in a
minute I'm assuming that many of you are
not familiar with IBC and if you think
you are you're probably thinking of IBS
which is irritable bowel syndrome the
two are very different but equally is
hard to talk about IBC is short for
inflammatory breast cancer and it is so
rare that society deems it as
unimportant because we are all a little
bit guilty of not fully caring or
understanding about something until it
is directly affecting us and that's
exactly how I felt I'd never heard of it
didn't know anything about it
and therefore didn't care until November
of 2016 when my mom was diagnosed i bc
is an extremely rare form of breast
cancer that makes up only 1% of the
entire population it makes up only about
5% of all breast cancer diagnoses it is
the cancer of the lymphatic system
meaning that it will always attack the
lymph nodes but seeks refuge in the
layers of skin on the breast which makes
it very aggressive and seemingly
undetectable through normal mammogram or
blood work it is the breast cancer that
consists of no lumps and no common
warning signs just a rash some
discoloration and pain that will occur
quickly in the span of about three days
to a week and although it may just
simply be a rash that can be cured with
a few creams or antibiotics if it has
not drastically improved with about in
about three days then you should seek
the help of a specialist because there's
a chance something is wrong my mom's
story started with a small rash on her
left breast and we didn't think much of
it because why would we it's just a rash
then some time went on and my mom
developed a dull pain in the same breast
so being a little concerned she did what
anyone would
and went to our family doctor and he
assured us that it was just a case of
the wrong bra size so we went and had
her fitted for new bras no change new
doctor another routine check from a
second doctor and showed us that it was
simply a sunburn which made sense at the
time because we live in Texas which is
known for its blistering heat just try
and stay out of the Sun and if you do go
out either cover up or apply lots of
sunscreen easy enough right
no change new doctor and by this time my
mom had developed a little bit of fear
but it was not enough to push the
doctors for more answers because after
all it was just a rash
another check it from a third doctor
ensured us that all it took to rid her
of this pesky rash that had now
transformed into a much bigger one was a
simple was a simple change in diet which
kind of forced my family to change our
eating habits and go for the healthier
options at the grocery store which
didn't go over well with my
seven-year-old sister Daisy Mae there
was still no change and by that time
that dull pain turned into an almost
unbearable one that spread from her left
breast down her arm and all throughout
the left side of her body so you know
how everyone tells you never to look up
your symptoms online because the results
are always way worse than your slight
sore throat or cold well my mom did
anyway and it saved her life
she took to the Internet and what she
found was devastating because on that
website the computer screen flashed the
words inflammatory breast cancer and a
sense of panic overcame her but was not
enough to provide permanent fear because
after all we had had three other doctors
insurace that she was fine so a couple
more months went by and we returned to
our primary doctor with our new concerns
and he laughed I have been in this
profession for years and I have never
had a case of ibc with any of my
patients I assure you that is not what
it is it is just too rare but what do we
remember from the definition I
previously stated rare does not mean
impossible so my mom was not convinced
this was not just a tip
Rashed i would go away in a matter of
days it had already been months and it
was excruciating ly painful so she went
had a mammogram done it came back clear
she had some blood work all normal so
what was the cause of this rash and pain
we then set out the help of a specialist
an oncologist from Baylor Scott and
White Hospital in Dallas
she took one look at my mom's condition
and sent her in for an emergency biopsy
and that biopsy confirmed what the
mammogram could not my mom had Stage
four inflammatory breast cancer in those
months she spent fighting and pushing
the doctors to do more tests the cancer
was spreading rapidly through her body
affecting not only her breasts but her
lymph node liver and bones the months
after my mom was diagnosed the house was
silent the only noise heard or the soft
sobs of each one of my family members in
different rooms of the house because no
one could bear to speak to each other
and no one wanted to come to the
realization but in a few years my mom
might not be with us when my mom was
diagnosed she said it was as if her
whole body went numb because the only
thing going through her mind was the
words on that computer screen that
flashed the words no survivors every
single case of stage four inflammatory
breast cancer has been fatal and the
reason that is is not only because it is
aggressive and quick to kill everything
in its path but because no one knows
about it according to the inflammatory
breast cancer research foundation the
treatment options for IBS er pretty
common with other forms of cancer
targeted chemotherapies radiation
treatments and surgery if that option is
available and by that I mean if the
cancer has spread to numerous parts of
the body like my mom's case surgery is
virtually useless the only surgery my
mom had to undergo was a full moon for
ectomy which removed her ovaries and
tubes because that is the part of the
body that produces a lot of the female
sex hormone estrogen and my mom's cancer
is estrogen receptive or er PR positive
which means that the
sturgeon ultimately feeds the cancer so
the surgery was to prevent any
unnecessary reason why the cancer could
spread and we had already gone through
countless hours waiting in treatment
holding my mom's hand as the medicine
burned through her body killing both
good and bad cells and weeks and weeks
of this went by and we all knew that
what was next was far more frightening
than the original diagnosis it was the
appointment to see if the treatment had
been working and we waited for what felt
like an eternity and we finally received
a phone call that would change the
course of everything because it was
working the cancer had disappeared from
all parts of my mom's body except the
liver so today she remains on an oral
chemotherapy which acts as an estrogen
blocker and keeps the cancer in her
liver at bay and she also has to work to
keep her weight at a healthy level
because that too can cause the cancer to
flare up and attack all over again
but overall her health is improving and
she is living her life to the fullest
you see the doctor gave my mom a
prognosis of three to five years of life
and we are making the most of them we go
on trips as a family we document moments
that make a smile and we keep each other
as our number one priority
and already she has become an advocate
with her work through love is greater
than cancer by talking to local people
in our community and local health
professionals who can learn from her PET
scans and biopsy results she has also
been featured in several news stories
and magazine articles all across the
world news stories that have been spread
from near and far in her local news
story has even won an Emmy Award because
of just one more person learns about IBC
it can spark a chain reaction of people
advocating their health and the health
of others take the story of Kate for
example kate is a woman who was sitting
at home watching TV when my mom's a news
story went live she noticed that she was
having similar symptoms with my mom but
the doctors had already pushed her fears
of the rare disease aside a few days
later we received a Facebook message
from Kate telling us that she went back
to the doctor and pushed
her own answers and she was diagnosed
with stage 3c inflammatory breast cancer
which is one stage before stage four and
suggests that the cancer has spread to
her lymph nodes and nowhere else my mom
having the courage to speak up about her
experience about with IBC and Cate
having the courage to go back and fight
gave her a few more days on this earth
and my mom was given and who knows how
many other people went to speak to their
doctors and that is powerful and that is
using this tragedy for something good
but now I want you to hear it from my
mom herself I had no idea the response
that I would get and it's been kind of
shocking to say the least
it's not easy to talk about something
that is that raw and and scary
once I started talking about my journey
I realized that the journey
is no longer about me dad
that inhale it's about everybody that
comes out and I just want to help them
[Music]
I still have a ton of hope and a very
and very strong faith I'm nowhere near
stopping my fight but to think that I
can maybe help somebody in theirs or
even better prevent someone from having
to go through what I'm going through
makes me feel like all this is is in a
weird way worth it
[Music]
you sort of go through life sort of
wondering what's your purpose joined to
be the best mom the best wife the best
dot are the best friend so this is a new
role for me and I'm gonna do the best
that I can it it makes me feel really
good
that's why I did that's why I spoke and
put myself out there is for that
somebody
and I want to carry on that legacy and
pass on the message that when it comes
to you in your health
you fight for answers when you feel like
there is something wrong because the
only person who knows what you are
feeling is you you are your own advocate
and I know is tough to argue with
professionals but even they make
mistakes we are not angry with the
doctors who misdiagnosed my mom in the
beginning because it was an issue of
unawareness not lack of caring but even
then you must speak up and fight for
your life because it could potentially
save it there is a known barrier between
institution and intuition and people
tend to be afraid when the institution
is telling them that no you are fine
there is no need to refer you to a
specialist but speak up and have a voice
life is too precious to be second
guessing and not following your
intuition go with your gut and listen to
what your body is telling you and yes it
is frustrating to think that if we had
just caught it a few months earlier
there would not nearly be as much
heartache but then again I would not be
given the chance to stand up here in
front of all of you and speak about the
important issue of self-advocacy so
speak up and when they try and tell you
that it is just too rare look them
straight in the eyes and say but rare
does not mean impossible",1,1,Non-Informative

something but failed to run with it
maybe it was something small like
sitting in a meeting not raising your
hand thinking they've already thought of
this maybe it was something bigger but
you shied away listening to that inner
voice that says what do you know about
such-and-such anyway
or maybe you passed up an opportunity to
solve a problem because your idea would
have gone against conventional wisdom
fifteen years ago I had passed up an
extraordinary opportunity an incredible
opportunity to solve a scientific
problem that could change the way we
think about cancer biology as fate would
have it I got a second chance and an
invitation to tell you about it so I'm a
developmental biologist and 15 years ago
I was giving a seminar on my research
and the question I was investigating at
the time is how cells become organized
during embryogenesis so we all start out
as a single cell that undergoes many
rapid rounds of division and as these
cells are generated they have to become
organized in a very specific pattern as
the embryo is growing and developing and
the pattern that our cells make is
called symmetry and this pattern of
symmetry is maintained all the way from
embryo Genesis throughout adulthood as I
think you can appreciate in this very
beautiful drawing by da Vinci now
looking internally this pattern of
symmetry continues in structures like
our paired organs things like the lungs
the kidneys the testes other organs that
are not included on this diagram now
there's also a second pattern in our
bodies it's called left-right asymmetry
and left-right asymmetry refers to these
individual organs these non paired
organs that are positioned leftward or
rightward in the body cavity and this
second pattern of left-right asymmetry
is thought of as the exception to the
rule it's a second pattern that is super
on this predominant pattern of symmetry
so here I was giving a talk explaining
how I use frog embryos aka tadpoles to
identify embryonic asymmetry genes and
to study how these genes control
organization of cells during
embryogenesis and at the end of my talk
someone asked me if I had heard that
certain cancers form more on one side of
the body than the other now I hadn't
heard of these left-right differences I
knew a lot about left-right asymmetry in
the context of embryos but I hadn't
heard of left-right differences in
cancer and I thought this was a
fascinating question so when I went back
home I very excitedly contacted my
colleagues who worked in the Cancer
Center asked them if they knew about
this and only a handful of people had
actually heard about it but we continued
our conversations and the consensus was
it's not very important the cancer
biologists thought there was probably
not much to it and so me being a
developmental biologist I stopped
thinking about it I kept working with my
tadpoles kept studying a symmetry
thinking well surely if it were that
important the cancer biologists would
have picked up it with it and started
running and you all know where this is
going right so fast forward about
another ten years and life gave me a
sudden left turn I was diagnosed with
stage 3 breast cancer I knew very little
about cancer and in particular breast
cancer so as I was undergoing treatments
for about two years I spent a lot of my
time reading about the disease and I
remembered that question that I had been
asked about left-right differences in
tumor incidents and so I decided to look
at the literature and to look at those
studies to see what had actually been
done and what I discovered in my reading
were three things the first is that this
phenomenon of tumors happening more on
one side of the body than the other had
been reported for multiple cancer types
for breast cancer more tumors develop in
the left breast
but those left-right differences
are not terribly dramatic so for breast
cancer about 55% of tumors develop on
the left and about 45% on the right so I
could see how the cancer biologists
would not find these differences to be
very meaningful
now as I continued reading the other
thing that I learned is that there was
some evidence some emerging idea little
hints here and there in the literature
that patients survival might be related
to the side of the body in which the
tumor develops and I thought this is
really important now there weren't a lot
of these studies and in fact I now know
that these studies are very difficult to
do because tumor laterality the location
the left or the right side location of
the tumor is not a parameter that is
typically included in these large-scale
databases these de-identified databases
that scientists like me have access to
so they're very difficult studies to
conduct nevertheless there was some
indication that there were left-right
differences and as someone who was
undergoing chemotherapy radiation
therapy many other treatments to survive
my disease even the prospect of
something that might influence disease
outcome that might influence survival
captured my attention in a way that I
just couldn't let go and so the third
thing that I learned in my reading is
that even though we had these
statistical studies that were out there
in the literature the cancer biologists
were not exploring this at the cellular
or the molecular level and I started
thinking wait a minute
this could be really important what if
we are potentially missing something
really big in cancer biology and so then
the internal dialogue kicked in I
started thinking about the tadpoles and
the experiments I've been doing and even
though there are organs such as the
heart that are built from cells from
both sides of the body so green cells
and red cells left cells and right side
cells that come together I could
appreciate
there were other tissues other
structures other organs in the body that
are very left-right distinct that are
not mingled and so I started thinking
well maybe the breasts are like this
maybe the breast during their
development are left-right different and
maybe this has something to do with
cancer but of course there was this
internal dialogue going on the classic
left-brain right-brain conversation the
advocate and the critic the dreamer and
the logician
they were all at the table and so I kept
thinking about it and decided that maybe
there are these left-right differences
so I continued reading about mammary
gland biology and the conventional
wisdom is that as with all parrot organs
the breasts are left-right identical in
fact in the medical textbooks only one
breast is diagrammed so prevalent so
entrenched is this belief of their
identical nature so this would have gone
very much against the conventional
wisdom and so I read some more I
discovered that some of the genes that
control embryonic asymmetry in the
tadpole no less are some of the same
genes that are also expressed in certain
breast tumors and so I was back to
thinking maybe there is something to
this and so this debate went on for
about a year and in the end there was a
tiebreaker
and that tiebreaker was the wallaby
sorry I can't drive these slides
Wallabies have this really cool thing
where the moms can simultaneously
produce two different types of milk so
if a mom has an infant Joey she can
produce a milk that's very high in
carbohydrate content on one side of her
body and simultaneously produce a milk
on the other side of her body that's
used to nurse her older toddler like
Joey and that milk is high in fat and
protein content and so when I learned
about
hobbies I thought well maybe this is not
so crazy
maybe mammary glands are left/right
different maybe in their development
they did become hardwired to have these
asymmetries and so at this point I
decided to switch my research to mammary
gland biology breast cancer I left
behind my frogs and tadpoles
reconfigured my lab to start working
with mice which by the way do have
mammary glands and very excitedly set up
to do our first experiment which was to
look at the internal structures of mouse
mammary glands I was thinking okay if
there are these left-right differences
then surely we will find left-right
differences in the internal networks the
part of the mammary gland where most
breast tumors originate and so we set up
the experiment I was so excited and I
was wrong I was crushed we looked at
litters and litters of mice and by any
parameter that we could measure they
were left-right identical and so when
this happens in science there are two
possibilities first either the
hypothesis is wrong or maybe you just
haven't run the appropriate experiment
and so I decided that we needed to dig a
little deeper and I'm so glad we did
because when we looked at the cellular
and the molecular level we found
profound left-right differences so we
were able to identify the gene
expression profiles from left-side
glands right-side glands and altogether
there are about 160 different genes that
are left-right differentially expressed
furthermore when we looked at the
cellular content of these glands there
are left-right differences in a
population of cells called the mammary
stem cells so the left side glands have
about twice as many mammary stem cells
as the right side glands and the reason
this is important is because many
scientists myself included think that
the mammary stem cells are the cells
that become mutated during cancer
development
so how
twice as many of these mammary stem
cells on the left side would elevate
risk for disease and in fact we know
based on the human data that more tumors
form in the left breast and so we were
quite excited about these results and
started thinking well maybe mammary
glands are differentially programmed for
their growth properties and so the next
experiment that we ran was to isolate
these cells from the left and the right
side mouse mammary glands we put them in
a dish in the laboratory where we could
analyze their growth properties and what
we found is that more of these cells
from the left side made these little
clusters we call them spheres and sphere
formation the quantity of sphere
formation is a reflection of the number
of mammary stem cells so this confirmed
our earlier observations but what was
really cool is that we also found
left-right differences in the sizes of
these spheres so in the right side
dishes even though there were fewer
spheres that formed fewer mammary stem
cells the spheres were larger and so
this suggests to us that the right side
cells might be programmed for more
aggressive growth and so at this point
we became even more excited we have a
lot of excitement in the lab and decided
that it's time to turn our attention to
a breast cancer mouse model hangout we
use a lot of different breast cancer
mouse models and this one that I'm going
to tell you about has an oncogene called
her2 and so when we looked at the ductal
networks in this breast cancer mouse
model what we found is that there were
very significant left-right differences
in these ductal networks so this is at
the very beginning of cancer development
a stage called neoplasia and from the
get-go I think you can appreciate even
without me showing you the numbers that
the right side networks in this breast
cancer mouse model are larger than those
on the left and so this confirmed what
we were seeing in the dishes so at this
point we're starting to accumulate a lot
of data in mice
and I wanted to know if what we're doing
is clinically relevant can we relate
what we're finding in our studies and
mouse models to what happens in breast
cancer patients and remember it's very
difficult to assess survival studies
relative to tumor laterality because
that information is not in the databases
but the information that is in the
databases for breast cancer patients is
the gene expression profile for the
patient's tumor and the survival rate so
what we were able to do is to take the
gene expression profiles that we had
identified in mice we have a left
profile and a right profile and we used
that information to take over 100 answer
patients and assign them into a left
group or a right group according to
which profile their tumors more closely
matched and when we did that we then
plotted their survival curves to look at
whether there were any left right
differences and the results were
remarkable the patients that were in the
left side group had far superior
survival compared to the patients in the
right side group and when we looked at
survival trends from the point of
diagnosis all the way throughout ten
years follow-up at any point in time the
patients in the left side group had a
35% chance higher of being alive than
the patients in the right side group and
these differences are based only on left
versus right so I'm convinced that what
we're doing in mice is clinically
relevant and more importantly I'm
convinced that tumor laterality the side
of the tumor as a very fundamental role
in the biology of that cancer and so I
want to tell you about one final
experiment that we've done and actually
this is a pretty new experiment we've
only had this data for a couple of
months and in thinking about survival
and thinking about the patient data one
of the questions that came to mind is
whether the different sides of our
bodies might respond differently to
chemotherapy drugs maybe this could
account
for some of these differences in the
survival rates because these are
patients who have gone through treatment
and so we turned back to our mouse model
and we were using the cells in the dish
but this time when we ran the experiment
we did something a little bit different
we added a drug called lapatinib which
is an anti-cancer drug it's one of the
drugs that's available to treat breast
cancer patients and when we added this
drug to the left side memory stem cells
as expected this drug inhibited their
growth and as we increase the
concentration of the drug the extent of
the growth inhibition also increased and
this is what you would expect with an
anti-cancer drug however when we did
this experiment with the cells from the
right side the drug failed to inhibit
their growth and this was astounding the
only difference in this experiment is
whether we had isolated the cells from
the left side of the mouse or the right
side of the mouse so this is yet another
bit of evidence telling us how important
tumor laterality is now I want to be
careful not to oversell this work there
is a world of difference between what
happens in cells in a dish what happens
themselves in a mouse and certainly what
happens themselves in a person right but
what I can say with certainty is that
mammary glands are left right different
they are left right asymmetric there are
very important differences in their
molecular properties and their cellular
properties and as far as we can tell in
their growth properties and so although
we don't have all of the answers I think
that with continued work as we continue
to identify more of these differences
and really understand the relationship
between our mouse models and what's
happening in patients that we will be
able to utilize this information not
only to improve treatments for breast
cancer patients but ultimately it is my
hope that we
can utilize this information to
strategize ways to prevent the disease
and so as we go through this research
cycle I'm very fortunate to not be alone
these experiments that I've described to
you today were conducted by a graduate
student in my lab Jacqueline Robichaux
and they were done in collaboration with
other scientists outside of my lab
doctors fusilar Hallett and hassel and
I'd also like to let you know that there
are three other students in my lab who
de shrewe ste and Ross they are the next
generation of scientists that are going
to be propelling this work forward and
so in wrapping up my story I want to
leave you with one final thought which
is that if everyone in this room if
everyone here today were to take a
chance challenge conventional wisdom
think about things a little differently
what might happen now I'm not suggesting
that you will go out and do something
like random cliff jumping okay I mean
there are certain conventional wisdoms
like the law of gravity that probably
are better left unchallenged you know
the distances have some pretty solid
data on gravity don't go there
but you know what I'm talking about what
I'm suggesting is that consider taking
the skills that you already have and
figuring out ways to apply your skills
to problems that you haven't necessarily

assist is critical and the net the study
we usually use to help us determine this
as a breast ultrasound and ultrasound is
not the best first-line study for
evaluating for breast cancer but it's a
great second line tool so if we have a
patient that is feeling a mass or we see
a mass on the mammogram usually one of
the next steps is to do the breast
ultrasound and what this does is you can
look at the mass and you can see if the
mass is made of fluid and then that is
called a cyst or if it's made of tissue
and then that's referred to as a solid
mass those are very separate entities a
cyst can usually be left alone most
often but a mass a solid mass made of
tissue will require additional
evaluation either with close follow-up
ultrasound or with a breast biopsy so
those are two very important entities
that we have to distinguish between one
thing women have to remember is they
have a screening mammogram and they may
get called back for additional views a
screening mammogram is only a screening
and if there is anything unusual on the
mammogram we're going to call you back
to work it up further and what women
need to remember is the vast majority of
time that we call you back it will not
be cancer it will be fibrocystic changes
or we can do an ultrasound show it's a
cyst and click clear it up but most
things we find are not cancer there
fibrocystic that they just need further
evaluation to determine that",NA,2,Informative

by mammal guide interpreting a mammogram
is the most basic skill in breast
imaging everyone says you need a
systematic approach but nobody tells you
what that approach is so today in the
next five minutes we are going to teach
you a super useful comprehensive
approach to reading a mammogram this
isn't the only way to do it but it is
one way and a good way to ensure you
don't miss anything so here we go first
you want to start by making sure that
images are technically okay a few
general requirements you want to ensure
adequate compression no motion or
artifacts and correct technique the
images aren't too dark they're not too
light next on the ml overview you want
to look and make sure the pectoralis
muscle goes down to the level of the
nipple next you want to ensure that the
inframammary fold is open and not
drooping next you want to make sure that
the glandular tissue is not cut off
posterior Lea switching our attention to
the cranial caudal view the posterior
nipple line is a line drawn from the
nipple to the back of the image on the
cranial caudal view this should be
within one centimeter of the distance
from the nipple to the bottom of the
pectoralis muscle on the MLL view next
you want to ensure you see a little bit
of retro glandular fat at the posterior
aspect of the cranial caudal view you
want to ensure that you include adequate
coverage of the medial tissue and
finally you want to ensure that the
nipple is in profile next here
once you've ensured that the mammogram
is technically okay you want to take a
quick general overview of the image we
like to use the 3 s's looking at size
symmetry and surgery compare the breast
side to side from here you're going to
compare with prior studies the more
prior exams you can obtain the better
you want to ensure that you can at least
go back two years if you see a small
mass or asymmetry that's been on the
images for several years you're done no
further workup is required from here
you're going to look closer at the MLL
view we're going to employ a technique
called shade symmetry
we are going to look specifically only
at 1/3 of the breasts at a time when you
first do this you may want to actually
take a piece of paper and cover the rest
of the breast this will allow you to
really focus in and compare side to side
with the right and left breast so we're
going to start looking at the upper
third then moving to the middle third of
the breast and finally to the lower
third of the breast from here we're
going to magnify the image and again
repeat those same steps looking at the
upper third the middle third and the
lower third of the breast in this
magnified view we're looking
specifically for groups of
calcifications from here we are going to
look at the five if the five key spots
that we want to ensure we include in our
evaluation of every mlo view first we
want to look specifically at the eggs
Allah
next we're going to look closer at the
nipple sub areola region approximately
20% of cancers occur in this region and
they can be very difficult to detect
from here we're going to look at the
edge of the glandular cone at this
interfaces where the majority of breast
cancers occur so you want to ensure that
your eyes make a rim around the outside
of this glandular tissue next we're
going to look a little closer at some
danger zones these are areas of fatty
tissue where really nothing should occur
and includes the retro glandular fat if
that superior and inferior to the
glandular tissue as well as taking a
quick look around the skin and edge of
the film for any abnormalities and the
final step of evaluating the MLL view is
to look for the widest brightest thing
on the film this is just a little trick
but it's amazing how often cancers will
appear as the brightest thing on the
film from here we're going to look a
little closer at the cranial caudal view
we're going to employ that same shade
symmetry technique this time starting
looking at the lateral third of the
breast from here moving to the middle
third and finally to the medial third of
the breast next we're going to magnify
the image and again repeat those same
steps but specifically looking for
calcifications in the lateral aspect the
middle third and fine
medial third then we want to make sure
we look at the five key spots not to be
missed on the cranial caught view and
these include the lateral breast and
majority of breast cancers occur out
laterally next we're going to look again
closer in that nipple sub area or region
from there we're going to do this edge
of the glandular comb again at that
interface of majority of cancers occur
from here we want to look at the danger
zones the areas of fatty tissue where
nothing should be present - this
includes the retro glandular fat the
medial breast and again looking at the
skin and edge of the film for any subtle
findings finally once again we want to
look for the whitest thing on the film
finally we want to look and at any total
synthesis images if you have these 3d
images available you want to scroll
through the cine images and with this
you're particularly looking for areas of
architectural Distortion
and then finally if you have not done it
already you want to look at any
computer-aided detection so click the
CAD on and off and just give a quick
second look to any area that marked the
vast majority of these markings you can
ignore but every once in a while it will
highlight an area that you may have
overlooked again this is how to read a
mammogram for more information please

V welcome to the hormone detox tribecommunity thanks so much for having meBridget I'm really excited to be here Iam excited to have you I want to share abit about like my background with you Iactually interviewed you a long time agowhen your book came out or was kind ofnew that knew her out I think it waslike four years ago I interviewed yousomething like that right first editioncame out for a while in 2014 so almostfive years now five years yeah it was anexcellent book can you tell people thename and the premise of it yes so thesecond edition just came out just got mybox in a few days ago it healed breastcancer naturally seven essential stepsto beating breast cancer oh goodso how or why would I even think aboutwriting a book like this because I'vebeen through breast cancer twice and soI think I've learned a few things alongthe way yeah and I remember for thefirst time I interview you you're yourpractitioner and you were doing liketons of healthy things so you werereally like stunned that you had breastcancer which I'm sure everyone like whenthey get that diagnosis you know youquestion like how did this happen what'sgoing on so can you tell us a bit aboutthat those early days yeah absolutely soI would was in practice for 25 yearsthis was back in 2004 and I was in theshower doing a you know breast examwhich I really didn't know what I wasdoing but I was just kind of feelingaround in there and then BAM you knowfelt that lump that changed my lifeforever professionally and personallyand you know I had to ask myself thosequestions how can somebody like medevelop cancer here I was teachingeverybody about wellness and health careand you know I seem to be the picture ofhealth I ate organic before organic wasin style I breastfed my kids I had homebirths exercise chiropractic care I meanyou name ityou know I did it and yet I was facingyou know this this breast cancer thislump in my left breast so that you knowled me down the road of lots of researchand soul-searching and and you knowthere were times where I was overwhelmedand frustrated and there was fear youknow just like any other woman wouldfeel when they're facing that kind ofjourney and then I realized I kind ofhad a lightbulb moment that you know Iwas all over the map and I was very youknow frustrated with the process so Isaid you know why don't I just create astep by step program that makes itsimple for meand for other women in the future sothat's when I created what I call this70 central system it's just a step bystep guide that walks you through thejourney and it breaks things down so youdon't have this big elephant you knowyou just start eating it one bite at atime so to speak yeah I remember readingI actually need to reread it so you gotthis new addition so I should I shouldreread it now I'll send you an you I'llsend you an updated copy oh I love ityeah because it really like it is anoverwhelming topic and when you're likeoh there's these seven areas it's likeoh okay I think I can handle that No somaybe tell us how you came to choosethese seven areas well because I feltthat each of those seven areas wereareas where I felt I had to do work andall those areas were very foundationaland part of my healing and so that's whyyou know I started with number one foodyou know essential number one like foodbe your medicine because food isfoundational right yes then I got intodetox you know essential number twosdetoxification like that yeah brain herenumber three has to do with balancingyour energy I mean we are one billionthphysical matter the rest is all energyand so chiropractic care acupunctureproper hormone balance sleep exerciseall those things you know fall under youknow your your energy number four is theemotions you know heal your emotionalwounds you know we are you know we livesuch a stressedfast-paced life all the time that wedon't even take time to unplug and toreally tune in and tune out the restof the things that are going on in theworld and and really looking atnurturing that inner child learning tolove yourself forgiving yourselfforgiving others you know that's a bigbig piece of healing because it's notjust you know I tell our clients all thetime it's not just getting rid of thelump or the bump but it's about acomplete transformation of your life youknow you can't keep doing the thingssame things you've done because you'llkeep getting the same results yes yeahso powerful yeahthen number five has to do with yourteeth biological dentistry you knowwhat's in your teeth is going to affectyour health you know through theenergetic attachment of the acupuncturemeridians and then through the you knowthe toxins that build up as a result ofroot canals or amalgams and number sixis all as therapeutic plants and herbsyou know air all the supplements all theherbs all the things that boost yourimmune system and it target cancer cellsnumber seven has to do with very earlydetection keeping a pulse on your healtheven you know while you're going throughthe cancer journey or after you know youwant to make sure that you keep a pulseon your health by using tools andtechnology out there that can help youstay on top of your health so you neverhave to face that journey again okay andwas changed at all since their originalbook was thermography and earlydetection number seven before it wasseven but there's you know definitelymore tests and more blood tests and moretools that we have available now than wedid you know four or five years ago forstore okay awesome you know why we youand I did some business trainingtogether and your husband was saying youcan't skip any steps and sometimes you alittle skip I guess any number of thetips but the dentistry is one it saysyou know people won't go do that orwon't look at the emotional wounds arethose too like the hardest people Thorwould usually usually they are you knowand I can tell you the you know numberfive the dental one when they resistthat and they you know they kind ofplateau and then they take the plungeyou know and we kind of nudge them tostart taking care of their mouth I meanwe always see those numbers startdropping and things start gettingbetter it's such a huge part of healingyeah I think that's a conversation thatstill not had enough in our spacethere's probably a little bit of a lackof biological dentist and and theredefinitely aren't like our space beingonline so but whenever I bring it outpeople write me and all who can I seeyou know I've got this bad tooth I'vegot these feelings so people are debt ison their minds but just what to do aboutit and yeah it's probably pretty costlyand maybe involves travel sometimes thatkind of a thing but yeah that's a veryinteresting area yeah I had to in mysecond journey so you want me to shareabout my second journey I would love itokay okay so back in 2015 so I was knownas the breast cancer Conqueror you knowand my team and I were coaching womenliterally all over the globe and I wasworking from sunup to sundown I mean Iwanted so desperately to help thesewomen because there was so many womenyou know reaching us and asking for helpand I need elected the signs and thesymptoms of my own health right I keptpushing through it i nose to the grindon not nose to the grindstone you knowhave to help these women you know justone more call you know one more emailand I I started realizing that I wasburnt out I was fatigued I had pain inmy left breastand bam you know felt a lump again thesame area and this one was even moredifficult because here I was the face ofbreast cancer conquer right all thesewomen were relying on me and I'm like amI afraid do the seven essentials reallywork you know how can I have breastcancer and I'm telling all these womenthat you know they can get well so I hadto work really really hard I had tochange a lot of things in my life youknow I pulled backI trained people to do the coaching Itook more time off I did more things tobring me joy less things that caused mepain and looked at the issues that thatcreated the perfect storm you know myhormones wereI was having firewood issues I had anautoimmune issue with my tooth top leftthat sat on the left breast meridian ihad something called root resorptionwhere the immune system attacked thetooth it was emptyyeah I mean they ate it from the insideout WowI know I had no idea there was just alittle tiny little dot on it and thenthe dentist said well let's just youknow patch it up and when she did I meanit did just the drill went right throughand it was empty I never heard of such athing huh so I had to address you knowthe autoimmune issue you know go back todo some more emotional work I mean Ireally had a great team I had you knowan awesome you know do you know medicaldoctor I had EFT coaches I had a naturalpath I mean I had all kinds of peopleyou know rallying around me and gettingme through that journey and then thegreat news is as of August of 2018everything is clear you know ultrasoundsbloodwork scans everything and so youknow I feel better and happier andhealthier than I did 20 years ago sothat's a good sign yeah yeah and youlook amazing you always look at youthank you I want to say a couple thingsabout about what you just said and thenkind of go on to this whole concept ofhealing naturally so you know so muchbut yet you you had to call on thetroops I think that's a really importantlesson um you know oh you're carrying alike a burden like you can't you can'tdo it alone and then then we're alwayslike susceptible again I think we're soyou know the idea of a cure is sotantalizing right but like like you saidthe conditions that make you sick we canrepeat those conditions we can go rightback to them yeah so it really is a partof lifestyle right not just like a quickfix exactly exactly and I would saythat's probably my biggest takeaway fromthe second time around is stress is notpart of my vocabulary anymore I startfeeling it I pull back I shut everythingoff and I I schedule time for myself youknow for meditation for exerciseor tennis you know it's just it's but Ienjoy my life now yes I still have a lotof busy work but there's so much morebalance in what I'm doingthat's so great so I know I know onething you said about your practice to meis there's people who have preventionpeople who just found out people who youknow different stages of the journey andI want I want to present to our audiencelike that this doesn't have to be scaryand you can approach this naturally sotell us I don't know it's not a greatquestion like I don't know tell us moreabout like I guess maybe like that modelof you know radiation and drugs and allthis which maybe seem like the only wayright well it was presented to us I lovewhat you do because you you reallystrongly exist in this paradigm thatthere's like another way of doing thingsand you really like hold space for thatbecause I think people do become soscared so tell us yeah maybe just tellus about like more about those optionsand how you've seen them like besuccessful well first of all when youget that diagnosis you know right awayyou know traditional medicine wants toput you on that you know that thattreadmill of you know bam bam bam let'sstart all these different therapies butthe thing you have to realize is thatyou have time right breast cancerdepending on circumstances is not acritical life-and-death situation rightit's not like having a heart attack soyou have time to look at your optionsand I'm not against you know women thatdo traditional medicine and I mean my myhat goes off to them because they'retaking a very difficult path they knowwhat they're getting into themselvesinto but you know that model is the youknow the whole philosophy is let'sdestroy this cancer without looking atthe root cause of what allowed thecancer to develop in the first placeand so we get women that are usingtraditional medicine but we teach themto support their bodies from all theside-effects of the you know thetherapies that they're getting and theycome out on the other side so we have amixture of both some women just dototally evidence-based natural medicinethey come out on the other side you knowmuch healthier and much happier now youknow we can't claim you know cure 100%success rate I mean everybody'sdifferent and you know I don't know whatgoes on behind closed doors in people'shomes and how they really live theirlife but you know just the other day Ijust received another in our Facebookgroup you know another one of ourclientsyou know oncologist says she's cleareverything looks good and and you knowit's it's it's it happens I mean I'mliving proof of it and in our communityis living proof of it as well okayyou've got a huge community your blogsare really great sometimes I'm searchingfor something you know your blogs comesout makes me happy so yeah you'veinfluenced like a lot of people so Iwonder if you could tell us again like alet me be where they can get the bookwhat else is to offer on your website Iknow you've got like a free gift as wellyeah so you can go to breast cancerconquer calm and we're and if you dofree slash not slash but - free - bookyou can get section two of the book iswide why did I develop breast cancerright the big question because I am inwonder you know why so breast cancerconquer comm 4/3 - book and you can geta section of the book for free and youcan find the book on Amazon okay awesomeI just want to share a little personalnote - like the first time I interviewedyou I was really happy to see that thisthe concepts are really giving you housenow I remember talking about that theycan help create hormone balance energylose weight because I know they come onmy attitude and probably it's common islike cancer something far away from meover there somewhere I hope I don't getitbut really practicing these concepts youlike you don't have to be with thediagnosis or thinking you will or anyyou know it's just like prevention it'sjust a healthy lifestyle and it's yeahit's really I think it's just importantto become a little closer to this topicand not push it so far awayso yeah I encourage people to check outthe book check out the site you knowthinking about it won't give you cancerlearning about it but not learning aboutit you know you could get find out muchlater that you have a cancer it'sexactly and there's and there's so manyways to be proactive with preventionyou know there's thermography if there'smammography that's what you choose to doultrasoundthere's blood work that you can do nowexcuse me that you know we call themliquid biopsies where they can actuallymeasure you know proteins and cancermethylation in the blood so you have anidea if you're actually producing breastcancer and you know when it comes toknowing the geography of your breastsyou know so many women are afraid to doa breast self-exam or they don't knowwhat they're doing and so we wanted tocreate a solution for that and wecreated something called my breastfriend now how many women out thereactually know how to do a breastself-exam you know we've never beentrained and it's it's really a shame sothe good news is there is a foundationcalled mammy Care Foundation thatcreated a breast model that looks likethis so it feels like real breast tissueon one side and it's got lumps hadvarious size various sizes and variousdepths in the model and this model wasactually used for the last 30 years toTrain medical doctors on how to do aproper breast exam you know how to feelwhat a you know suspicious let me feellike and so the manufacturer of themodel asked me to take this to thegeneral public so women can now haveaccess to this model and learn with aninstruction booklet and video how to doa proper breast self-exam because it'snot just poking and feeling your breastthere's got to be a method to it no Idon't know the proper way and we havethat link below the video as well if youwant to check out my breast friends soit's really a great tool as well sothank you for all your workI really appreciate what you're doingand coming on to share we'll make surewe share this in a few few platforms soso thank you so hard yeah thanks for Jenit's been awesome thanks for for sharingmy message of hope our mission is tosave lives one breast at a time I

22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hgrfXleNsM,31,51,7,11984,"Breast cancer is a cancer that originates in the breast.What's important to know about breast cancer is that even though all breast cancer comesout of one part of the body, it's actually three different diseases.The three main categories are defined by the receptors on the outside of the cancer cells.One of the most important things to know is what kind of breast cancer is it.The entire treatment plan depends on which category of breast cancer someone's diagnosed with.So sitting down with one of the doctors and going through the pathology report to reallyunderstand what is the diagnosis and what type of breast cancer is it.The largest category of breast cancer is hormone receptor positive breast cancer.That means breast cancer that has estrogen and/or progesterone receptors on the outside.The second most common type has a different kind of receptor called HER2.The third type of breast cancer, which is the smallest category, lacks the receptorsfor estrogen and progesterone and lacks the HER2 receptor.Therefore, it has none of those three receptors.We call it triple negative breast cancer.There usually are at least three doctors who are on the breast cancer treatment team.This includes a surgeon who does breast surgery, a radiation oncologist who may or may notbe necessary on the team, and then a medical oncologist who provides what's called systemictherapy, so therapy that goes throughout the body.It's very important for someone newly diagnosed with breast cancer to have a treatment teamthat she or he feels comfortable with and who communicate well together and can workas a team to make the best treatment plan.There are many factors that the treatment team needs to consider.The three main categories that I think about include the anatomy of the cancer.This is the stage of breast cancer.How large is the cancer?And is there any evidence the cancer could have gotten into the lymph nodes under thearm, what we consider the regional lymph nodes.The next category is the biology of the cancer, like the personality.This has to do with those categories of breast cancer, hormone receptor positive, HER2 positive,or triple negative and some other features about the growth pattern of the cancer.And then the third category is who is the person with the breast cancer diagnosis.What is their health like?Are there other important health issues that the treatment team needs to consider?And also, what are someone's preferences?What do they want to do in terms of their treatment decisions?All of those features come together to make a treatment plan.So for someone who is newly diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, meaning cancerlimited to the breast and/or regional lymph nodes, there are typically two main partsof treatment, what we call local therapy and systemic therapy.Local therapy means treatments that are focused and directed on specific parts of the bodysuch as on the breast and lymph nodes.And this includes surgery and can also include radiation treatments.In a woman who has had a lumpectomy, meaning that the breast is preserved, often radiationtreatment is included in the program as well.If someone's had a mastectomy, most of the time radiation is not necessary, but occasionallyit will be recommended as well.Systemic therapy means whole body treatment, so something that someone will take by mouthor vein that travels everywhere in the body, not just breast and lymph node areas.And this is the type of treatment that a medical oncologist provides.There are three main categories of systemic treatment that a medical oncologist can select from.We have what's called hormone therapies, also known as endocrine therapies.And these are the medicines that block the body's hormones from stimulating cancer cells.This includes pill medicines such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors.The second category is the chemotherapy category.Most of the time that's intravenous treatment.And then the third category, what we sometimes think of as the most exciting category inbreast cancer, is what we call targeted or biologic therapy.That means treatments that are very specific for cancers and very precise for cancers butare not chemotherapy treatments and are really designed to go after the cancer but not harmor touch any other tissues in the body.When a person who's newly diagnosed with breast cancer sits down with their medical oncologist,they can review each of these categories and see which medicines, if any, from any of thesecategories would be appropriate to treat the cancer.There's kind of two large arenas of progress that we've seen over the past several yearsfor breast cancer.The first one has to do with how much treatment is appropriate for someone with a breast cancer diagnosis.If we look at the history of how we've developed our successful breast cancer treatments, it'susually by adding more and more treatments to the program.More surgery.More radiation.More chemotherapy.The newest trend, though, is realizing that not every person needs the same treatment.Treatment should not be homogenous.Instead, it should be highly personalized to a person and to his or her situation.And so the newest research is actually looking at ways to pull back and to give exactly what'sneeded to best treat the cancer but not expose somebody to a treatment that's unnecessaryor unhelpful.So we actually now see situations where we're able to pull back and not have to offer chemotherapyin the ways we might have in the past or not have to do excessive surgery if that's notnecessary for the treatment program.The other main area where we've seen great progress is in this category of targeted therapies.There's a wealth of targeted therapies that have been evaluated in clinical trials, andevery year we are seeing these medicines emerge out of trials, become FDA approved, and becomepart of our standard treatment program.Cancer.Net is a wonderful website that provides terrific information, easy to understand informationabout all kinds of cancer, especially breast cancer.And there are

Don't cause any pain or discomfort until they spread to nearby tissuesThe breasts are milk-producing glands that sit on the chest wall on either side of the breastboneThey lie on top of the ribs and the pectoral muscles and they're divided into three main partsThe glandular tissue that makes the milk is made up of 15 to 20 lobulesInside each of these lie a bunch of grape like structures called the AVO lieWhich are modified sweat glands surrounded by a basement membrane made largely of collagenZooming in on the a voi there's a layer of avalor cells that secrete breast milk into the lumenWhich is the space in the center of the gland?wrapping around the alveolus our special myoepithelial cellsthat squeeze down and push the milk out of the lumen of the alveolus down the lactiferous ducts andout one of the pores of the nippleNow surrounding the glandular tissue is the stroma which contains adipose or fat tissue and this makes up the majority of the breastSuspense Ettore ligaments called Cooper's ligaments run through the stroma and help keep it in placeThese ligaments attach to the inner surface of the breast on one end and the pectoralis muscle on the otherJust beneath the skin covering the breast there's a network of tiny lymphatic vessels that drain the lymphWhich is a fluid containing cellular waste products and white blood cellsThese lymphatic vessels mainly drain into a group of lymph nodes in the axilla or the armpitNow the cells of glandular tissue have receptors for certain hormones like estrogen and progesterone which are released by the ovaries inprolactin, which is released by the pituitary glandThese hormones stimulate the ABI alure cells to divide an increase in number which makes the lobule enlargedWithout these hormones the glandular cells particularly the alveolar cells can survive and undergo apoptosis, which is programmed cell deathfor example after menopause estrogen production stopsWhich leads to death of the Abiola cells and over time that breast tissue gets replaced by fatDuring the menstrual cyclethere's increased secretion of estrogen and progesterone from the ovaries and right after menstruation that secretion decreases asA result during every menstrual cycle the alveolar cells undergo division and apoptosisMen have some breast tissue as well, but they lack milk secreting a voiEach time cells divide there's a chance that a genetic mutation will occur and a mutation can lead to tumor formationSo with more menstrual cycles, there's an increased risk of tumor formationThat's why there's an increased risk of breast cancer with things that increase the number of menstrual cycles, like early age of menarcheWhich is the first menstrual bleeding and late age of menopause?similarlyMedications containing estrogen also increase the risk of breast cancerThere are also other environmental risk factors such as ionizing radiationlike from chest x-rays and CT scans onThe flip side some things that are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer include early pregnancy and a longer time breastfeedingBreast cancer has also been linked to specific mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as breast cancer gene or brca1 and brca2And T p53 which normally slowed down cell division or make cells die if they divide uncontrollablymutations in brca1 or brca2Are both autosomal dominant mutations, which can be inherited and cause familial breast cancer in addition to breast cancerThey also cause an increased risk of ovarian cancerSome breast cancers also have mutations in the erbb2 gene that increased human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 orher2 which when activated promotes the growth of cells inMales breast cancer is usually caused by inherited mutations in the brca1 and 2 genesOnce a cancer-causing mutation does occur the affected cell which is most commonly an epithelial cell that lines the ducts or the lobulesbegins to grow and replicate out of control forming a tumorThis tumor also called an in situ carcinoma is initially localized within the basement membrane of the apo eye and can be of two typesThe first type is called ductal carcinoma in situ or DCISAnd that's where tumor cells grow from the wall of the ducts into the womenIf left untreated DCIS over time can cross the basement membrane to become invasive ductal carcinomaAlso cancer cells from DCIS can migrate along the elective first duct and through the pore onto the skin over the nipple?This is called Paget disease of the nipple these cancer cells release a substance called mobility factorWhich helps them break into and settle in between the squamous epithelial cells as the cancer cells move into the epitheliumThere's inflammation which brings extracellular fluid out through breaks in the skin this fluid then dries and forms crusts over the skin surfaceThe second type is called lobular carcinoma in situ or LC is and that's where clusters of tumor cells grow within the lobulesWithout invading the ducts causing the affected a voi to enlargeUnlike DCIS over time LC is doesn't cross the basement membrane to form invasive lobular carcinomaLC is got its name many years agoBefore it was realized that it's not a breast cancer in the sense that it doesn't invade surrounding tissuesJust like healthy avio ourselves some breast cancer cells have hormone receptors that allow them to grow in the presence of the hormonesBased on the type of hormone receptors breast cancers can be divided into three major typesEstrogen receptor or ER positive and her2 negative carcinoma, which is most commonher2 positive and ER positive negative carcinoma andER negative in her to negative carcinomaBreast cancer can cause a few complicationsFirst the tumor causes local inflammation which causes damage to the suspensory ligaments and latias ducts resulting in their fibrosisNext the cancer can invade nearby tissues like the pectoral muscles below and the skin above?Cancer cells can also enter and block the thin lymphatic vessels which causes lymph to build up in the interstitial spaceNormally this fluid buildupWhat causes swelling but the attachment of suspense Atari ligaments doesn't allow the skin to stretchSo the skin becomes thickened and dimpled like an orange peel called po d'orange appearancefinally tumor cells can spread via the blood to the spine brain and bone or the lymph to other sites likeaxillary lymph nodes and the other breast inMales breast tissue is very thin which makes it easier for the cancer to spread to underlying tissuesThe first symptom of breast cancer is a hard painless lump or swellingWhich is most commonly in the upper and outer part of the breastAdditionally, there may be a swelling under the armpit if cancer is spread to the axillary lymph nodesThe breast can become a mobile and fixed or stuck onto the chest wall due to infiltration if cancer cells spreadinto the pectoral musclesAnother symptom is dimpling of the skin over the breast due to involvement of the skinFibrosis of taras ducks and suspense story ligaments causes retraction or pulling in of the nipplesWhen pageant disease is present it can cause itching redness crusting and discharge from the nippleDiagnosis of breast cancer usually begins by feeling a breast lumpBreast cancer can be treated effectively when it is detected early in the course of the diseasethat's why regular screaming with mammography which is an x-ray of the breasts is done in high-risk individuals inAddition imaging using ultrasound and MRI may be done to detect the tumorFinally a biopsy of the swelling or a fine needle aspiration and cytologyWhere fluid from the swelling is taken may be done to confirm the diagnosisTo determine the risk of breast cancer. Each one is staged by the TNM systemT indicates the size of the tumor and whether or not it is grown in nearby areasFor example, the chest wall muscles and describes the degree to which cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodesparticularly the axillary lymph nodes andFinally M indicates the degree to which the cancer has spread to other sites or metastasizedEach of these categories is ranked from zero to four with four being the most severeFinally the combinations of these sub stages determine the stage group which are assigned zero to fourTreatment for breast cancer is based on the type and stage of the cancer but commonly involves surgery radiation therapy chemotherapyand hormonal therapyLocalized tumors are removed surgically by partial mastectomy where the affected part is removed in larger tumorsWhich have spread to nearby tissue are removed by total mastectomy where the entire breast is removed inAddition nearby structures like lymph nodes may also be removed if the cancer has metastasized to themHormone therapy is used when tumor cells have hormone receptors like estrogen and her2 inMay include medications which block the formation or effects of estrogenAll right as a quick recapBreast cancer or breast carcinoma is the uncontrolled growth of epithelial cells lining the ducks and lobules of the breastBreast cancer usually begins as an in situ carcinoma, which can either be ductal carcinoma in situ or DCISWhich is localized to the ducts or lobular carcinoma in at you or LCIS, which is localized within the lobulesOver time in situ carcinoma can invade the basement membrane to become invasive carcinoma?involving the ducks and lobulesBreast cancer screening by mammography is done for early detection of cancerWhich can be treated by a variety of treatment options including surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy in hormonal therapyThanks for watching if you're interested in a deeper dive on this topic take a look at as Moses org where we have flashcardsQuestions and other awesome tools to help you learn medicine",1,0,Non-Informative
